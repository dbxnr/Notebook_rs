[1m1[0m: [1m2020-11-21 21:14:00[0m	Lupin turned up for a few minutes in the evening.  He asked for a drop of brandy with a sort of careless look, which to my mind was [31mtheatrical[0m and quite ineffective.  I said: “My boy, I have none, and I don’t think I should give it you if I had.”  Lupin said: “I’ll go where I can get some,” and walked out of the house.  Carrie took the boy’s part, and the rest of the evening was spent in a disagreeable [31mdiscussion[0m, in which the words “Daisy” and “Mutlar” must have occurred a thousand times.
[1m2[0m: [1m2021-04-22 16:14:00[0m	I have of late [31mfrequently[0m noticed Carrie rubbing her nails a good deal with an [31minstrument[0m, and on asking her what she was doing, she replied: “Oh, I’m going in for [31mmanicuring[0m.  It’s all the fashion now.”  I said: “I suppose Mrs. James [31mintroduced[0m that into your head.”  Carrie [31mlaughingly[0m replied: “Yes; but everyone does it now.”
[1m3[0m: [1m2021-05-13 22:17:00[0m	A terrible [31mmisfortune[0m has happened: Lupin is [31mdischarged[0m from Mr. Perkupp’s office; and I scarcely know how I am writing my diary.  I was away from office last Sat., the first time I have been absent through illness for twenty years.  I believe I was poisoned by some lobster.  Mr. Perkupp was also absent, as Fate would have it; and our most valued customer, Mr. [31mCrowbillon[0m, went to the office in a rage, and withdrew his custom.  My boy Lupin not only had the assurance to receive him, but recommended him the firm of Gylterson, Sons and Co. Limited.  In my own humble judgment, and though I have to say it against my own son, this seems an act of treachery.
